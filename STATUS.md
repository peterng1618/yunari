Branch: `feat/game-identity`

## Current objective

**Game identity and the display catalogue** ([`spec`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-24-game-identity-and-display-catalogue-design.md), [`plan`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-24-game-identity-and-display-catalogue.md), [decision 0110](docs/decisions/0110-game-identity-is-a-local-catalogue-match.md)): `game.running` means an identified game, not any foreground window, and the player converts custom source units.

- **Active plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-24-game-identity-and-display-catalogue.md`

## Active work

- **Phase 3 (shared descriptor mapping)**: Task 3.1 done; **Task 3.2 (editor uses the shared mapper) is next**, then the player catalogue and its e2e.
- **Phase 2 (classifier)** replaces `game.running`'s pid check with catalogue, runtime-marker and window evidence, debounced.
- **Phase 4 (player catalogue)** moves the wire mapping to `renderer-core` and passes descriptors to `refreshBoundText`.
- **Windows-first**: Linux catalogue readers and foreground detection stay out, recorded in the spec.
- **Store search is not a presence signal**: the Steam lookup stays demand-driven for name and artwork only.

## Last completed change

- **Task 3.1** (`1e1667ef`, tests `541184d7`, `acfd95d0`): `renderer-core/src/data/sensor-catalogue.ts` owns `descriptorFromWire` + `descriptorsFromWire`, exported from the package index; editor file untouched until 3.2.
- **Review** passed spec and quality; two fix commits made each filtered-field test prove the entry survives, not just that the field is absent.
- **Evidence:** focused 14/14 tests exit 0 (renderer-core + editor), reviewer re-ran renderer-core typecheck exit 0; full gate not re-run (pure move, Phase 3 gate follows 3.2).

## Next

1. Execute Phase 1, then Phase 2, 3 and 4 through the subagent loop; gate at each phase end.
2. Close vg-723, vg-724 (Windows half) and vg-717 with checks and artefact shas; file the Linux presence gap separately.
3. Raise the stale AGENTS.md Playwright port range (4215–4237) with the user; 4239 and 4245 are now used.

## Blockers / unverified

- **No live game check yet**: the classifier's window evidence needs a real fullscreen game; the e2e uses a fixed foreground seam.
- **Epic, itch and Xbox formats are undocumented**: readers are fixture-tested only, and itch is absent on this PC.
- **GOG registry read costs one PowerShell process per demand window**; caching is designed but unmeasured.
- **Linux presence has no owner**: no foreground source exists outside Windows.
- **No live Steam store request or live frame reading**; both remain fixture-tested.
